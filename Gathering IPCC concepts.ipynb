The term aerosol, which includes both the particles and the suspending gas, is often used in this report in its plural form to mean ‘aerosol particles’. Aerosols may be of either natural or anthropogenic origin in the troposphere; stratospheric aerosols mostly stem from volcanic eruptions. Aerosols can cause an effective radiative forcing directly through scattering and absorbing radiation ( aerosol–radiation interaction ), and indirectly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei or ice nucleating particles that affect the properties of clouds ( aerosol–cloud interaction ), and upon deposition on snow- or ice-covered surfaces. Atmospheric aerosols may be either emitted as primary particulate matter or formed within the atmosphere from gaseous precursors (secondary production). Aerosols may be composed of sea salt, organic carbon, black carbon (BC) , mineral species (mainly desert dust), sulphate, nitrate and ammonium or their mixtures.\n",

The EAsiaM manifests during boreal summer with warm and wet southerly winds, but also during boreal winter with cold and dry northerly winds. In late April/early May, rainfall onsets in the central Indochina Peninsula, and in mid-June the rainy season arrives over East Asia with the formation of the Meiyu front along the Yangtze River valley, Changma in Korea and Baiu in Japan. In July, the monsoon advances up to North China, the Korean peninsula and central Japan. During boreal winter, strong north-westerlies manifest over north and north-east China, Korea and Japan, while strong north-easterlies arrive along the coast of East Asia.

This oceanic event is associated with a fluctuation of a global-scale tropical and subtropical surface pressure pattern called the Southern Oscillation. This coupled atmosphere–ocean phenomenon, with preferred time scales of two to about seven years, is known as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The warm and cold phases of ENSO are called El Niño and La Niña, respectively. ENSO is often measured by the surface pressure anomaly difference between Tahiti and Darwin and/or the sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. This phenomenon has a great impact on the wind, sea surface temperature and precipitation patterns in the tropical Pacific.

Solar radiation is the dominant source of energy into the Earth system. Incoming solar energy may be scattered and reflected by clouds and aerosols or absorbed in the atmosphere. The transmitted radiation is then either absorbed or reflected at the Earth’s surface. The average albedo of the Earth is about 0.3, which means that 30% of the incident solar energy is reflected into space, while 70% is absorbed by the Earth. Radiant solar or shortwave energy is transformed into sensible heat, latent energy (involving different water states), potential energy, and kinetic energy before being emitted as infrared radiation .

In addition, extreme sea levels can be influenced by changes in the frequency, tracks or strength of weather systems and storms, or due to anthropogenically induced changes such as the modification of coastlines or dredging. In turn, changes in any or all of the contributions to extreme sea levels may lead to long term relative sea-level changes. Alternate expressions for ESL may be used depending on the processes resolved. Extreme still water level (ESWL) refers to the combined contribution of relative sea level change, tides and storm surges. Wind-waves also contribute to coastal sea level via three processes: infragravity waves (lower frequency gravity waves generated by wind waves), wave setup (time-mean sea-level elevation due to wave energy dissipation) and swash (vertical displacement up the shore-face induced by individual waves). Extreme total water level (ETWL) is the ESWL plus wave setup. When considering coastal impacts, swash is also important, and extreme coastal water level (ECWL) is used.\n",

      "Definition: Changes in Earth gravity, Earth rotation and viscoelastic solid Earth deformation (GRD) result from the redistribution of mass between terrestrial ice and water reservoirs and the ocean. Contemporary terrestrial mass loss leads to elastic solid Earth uplift and a nearby relative sea level fall (for a single source of terrestrial mass loss this is within ~2000 km, for multiple sources the distance depends on the interaction of the different relative sea level patterns). Farther away (more than ~7000 km for a single source of terrestrial mass loss), relative sea level rises more than the global average, due (to first order) to gravitational effects. Earth deformation associated with adding water to the oceans and a shift of the Earth’s rotation axis towards the source of terrestrial mass loss leads to second-order effects that increase spatial variability of the pattern globally. GRD effects due to the redistribution of ocean water within the ocean itself are referred to as self-attraction and loading effects.\n",

      "Definition: The infrared radiative effect of all infrared-absorbing constituents in the atmosphere . Greenhouse gases (GHGs) , clouds, and some aerosols absorb terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface and elsewhere in the atmosphere. These substances emit infrared radiation in all directions, but, everything else being equal, the net amount emitted to space is normally less than would have been emitted in the absence of these absorbers because of the decline of temperature with altitude in the troposphere and the consequent weakening of emission. An increase in the concentration of GHGs increases the magnitude of this effect; the difference is sometimes called the enhanced greenhouse effect. The change in a GHG concentration because of anthropogenic emissions contributes to an instantaneous radiative forcing . Earth’s surface temperature and troposphere warm in response to this forcing, gradually restoring the radiative balance at the top of the atmosphere.\n",

      "Name: greenhouse gas emission metric\n",
      "Definition: A simplified relationship used to quantify the effect of emitting a unit mass of a given greenhouse gas (GHG) on a specified key measure of climate change . A relative GHG emission metric expresses the effect from one gas relative to the effect of emitting a unit mass of a reference GHG on the same measure of climate change. There are multiple emission metrics, and the most appropriate metric depends on the application. GHG emission metrics may differ with respect to: (i) the key measure of climate change they consider; (ii) whether they consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated over a specified time horizon; (iii) the time horizon over which the metric is applied; (iv) whether they apply to a single emission pulse, emissions sustained over a period of time, or a combination of both; and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission compared to the absence of that emission or compared to a reference emissions level or climate state. [Note:Most relative GHG emission metrics (such as the g lobal warming potential (GWP) , global temperature change potential (GTP), global damage potential, and GWP*), use carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as the reference gas. Emissions of non-CO2 gases, when expressed using such metrics, are often referred to as ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ emissions. A metric that establishes equivalence regarding one key measure of the climate system response to emissions does not imply equivalence regarding other key measures. The choice of a metric, including its time horizon, should reflect the policy objectives for which the metric is applied.]\n",

The subject can be an entity such as a country, an organisation, a district or a commodity, or an activity such as a service or an event. GHG neutrality is often assessed over the lifecycle, including indirect (‘scope 3’) emissions, but can also be limited to the emissions and removals, over a specified period, for which the subject has direct control, as determined by the relevant scheme. The quantification of GHG emissions and removals depends on the GHG emission metric chosen to compare emissions and removals of different gases, as well as the time horizon chosen for that metric [Note 1: Greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are overlapping concepts. The concepts can be applied at global or sub-global scales (e.g., regional, national and sub-national). At a global scale, the terms greenhouse gas neutrality and net zero greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent. At sub-global scales, net zero GHG emissions is generally applied to emissions and removals under direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity, while GHG neutrality generally includes emissions and removals within and beyond the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. Accounting rules specified by GHG programmes or schemes can have a significant influence on the quantification of relevant emissions and removals. Note 2: Under the Paris Rulebook (Decision 18/CMA.1, annex, paragraph 37), parties have agreed to use GWP100 values from the IPCC AR5 or GWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC Assessment Report to report aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs. In addition, parties may use other metrics to report supplemental information on aggregate emissions and removals of GHGs. Note 3: In some cases, achieving greenhouse gas neutrality may rely on the supplementary use of offsets to balance emissions that remain after actions by the reporting entity are taken into account.]\n",

Typically, the positive phase of the PDV is characterized by anomalously high sea surface temperatures in the central-eastern tropical Pacific that extend to the extratropical North and South Pacific along the American coasts, encircled to the west by cold sea surface anomalies in the mid-latitude North and South Pacific. The negative phase is accompanied by sea surface temperature anomalies of the opposite sign. Those sea surface temperature anomalies are linked to anomalies in atmospheric and oceanic circulation throughout the whole Pacific Basin. The PDV is associated with decadal modulations in the relative occurrence of El Niño and La Niña. See Section AIV.2.6 in Annex IV of the AR6 WGI report.\n",

      "Definition:  In the context of climate variations, the response time or adjustment time is the time needed for the climate system or its components to re-equilibrate to a new state, following a forcing resulting from external processes. It is very different for various components of the climate system. The response time of the troposphere is relatively short, from days to weeks, whereas the stratosphere reaches equilibrium on a time scale of typically a few months. Due to their large heat capacity, the oceans have a much longer response time: typically decades, but up to centuries or millennia. The response time of the strongly coupled surface–troposphere system is, therefore, slow compared to that of the stratosphere, and mainly determined by the oceans. The biosphere may respond quickly (e.g., to droughts ), but also very slowly to imposed changes.

      "Definition: Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) have been developed to complement the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). By design, the RCP emission and concentration pathways were stripped of their association with a certain socio-economic development. Different levels of emissions and climate change along the dimension of the RCPs can hence be explored against the backdrop of different socio-economic development pathways (SSPs) on the other dimension in a matrix. This integrative SSP-RCP framework is now widely used in the climate impact and policy analysis literature, where climate projections obtained under the RCP scenarios are analysed against the backdrop of various SSPs. As several emissions updates were due, a new set of emissions scenarios was developed in conjunction with the SSPs. Hence, the abbreviation SSP is now used for two things: On the one hand SSP1, SSP2, …, SSP5 are used to denote the five socio-economic scenario families. On the other hand, the abbreviations SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, …, SSP5-8.5 are used to denote the newly developed emissions scenarios that are the result of an SSP implementation within an integrated assessment model. Those SSP scenarios are bare of climate policy assumption, but in combination with so-called shared policy assumptions (SPAs), various approximate radiative forcing levels of 1.9, 2.6, …, or 8.5 W m –2 are reached by the end of the century, respectively.\n",
