      "visiting the house, or photographing or sketching its exterior. \n",
      "The Rietveld Schröder House is still a landmark. And rightly so. \n",
      "Centraal Museum has been fortunate to manage the house \n",
      "since 1987, which has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site \n",
      "since 2000.\n",
      "INTRODUCTION\n",
      "In 2000, the Rietveld Schröder House was listed as a UNESCO \n",
      "World Heritage Site. The qualification reads as follows: “The \n",
      "Rietveld Schröderhuis in Utrecht is an icon of the Modern \n",
      "Movement in architecture and an outstanding expression of \n",
      "human creative genius in its purity of ideas and concepts as \n",
      "developed by the De Stijl movement. With its radical approach \n",
      "to design and the use of space, the Rietveld Schröderhuis \n",
      "occupies a seminal position in the development of architecture \n",
      "in the modern age.” (WHC Nomination Documentation 16 June \n",
      "1999).”\n",
      "This management plan describes what is known as Outstanding \n",
      "Universal Values - cultural and/or natural values so exceptional \n",
      "that they transcend national boundaries and are of common \n",
      "interest to present and future generations of all humanity. In \n",
      "1972, the guidelines for World Heritage were laid down by \n",
      "UNESCO in the ‘Convention Concerning the Protection of the \n",
      "World Cultural and Natural Heritage’. In 1992, the Netherlands \n",
      "ratified this convention and committed itself to preserving the \n",
      "World Heritage on its territory.\n",
      "Based on the ‘Operational guidelines for the implementation of \n",
      "the World Heritage Convention’ (last revised in 2021), a \n",
      "management plan has been required for each World Heritage \n",
      "Site since 2005. As the Rietveld Schröder House did not initially \n",
      "have a management plan, it was decided in 2012, in consultation \n",
      "between the Cultural Heritage Agency and Centraal Museum, to \n",
      "draw up this plan. The financial resources needed for this were \n",
      "made available by the Ministry of Education, Culture and \n",
      "Science through the Werelderfgoed.nl foundation. \n",
      "Werelderfgoed.nl facilitated the planning process, and Centraal \n",
      "Museum and partners contributed in the form of staff support. \n",
      "The plan had a time horizon of 10 years. In 2022, Centraal \n",
      "Museum took the initiative to revise the plan. The present \n",
      "document is the revised plan in which we (Centraal Museum) \n",
      "describe the plans for the coming years. This plan again \n",
      "assumes a time horizon of 10 years.\n",
      "OBJECTIVE AND CONTENT\n",
      "Based on the commitment to World Heritage conservation, the \n",
      "purpose of the management plan is to show how the \n",
      "conservation of the site’s universal values is organised. This \n",
      "includes management, implementation programmes, monitoring \n",
      "and resources, and how the roles of the parties involved are \n",
      "distributed. Management aims to ensure that the site’s values, \n",
      "authenticity and integrity are preserved for the future. \n",
      "The operational guidelines, which are updated every two years, \n",
      "describe this as follows: “Each nominated property should have \n",
      "an appropriate management plan or other documented \n",
      "management system which must specify how the Outstanding \n",
      "Universal Value of a property should be preserved, preferably \n",
      "through participatory means. The purpose of a management \n",
      "system is to ensure the effective protection of the nominated \n",
      "property for present and future generations.” In addition to the \n",
      "guidelines described above, the Management Plans for World \n",
      "Heritage Sites: A Practical Guide (Ringbeck, B., 2008) provides \n",
      "an important framework for the compilation of this management \n",
      "plan.\n",
      "The management plan is a working document for the site holder \n",
      "that contains all the relevant information in relation to the \n",
      "preservation and management of the World Heritage Site. In \n",
      "case of the Rietveld Schröder House it is essentially a collective \n",
      "overview of information that is created, collected and stored in \n",
      "different places: the management of the house is performed by \n",
      "Centraal Museum, so that all plans concerning maintenance, \n",
      "security, education and such are part of the (long-term) policy \n",
      "plans of Centraal Museum. Considering that the management of \n",
      "a monument of this stature requires continuous monitoring, \n",
      "Centraal Museum has decided to complement this “static” \n",
      "Gerrit Thomas Rietveld (1888 - 1964) was a Utrecht furniture \n",
      "maker of a strict Christian Reformed background. The Rietveld \n",
      "Schröder House was the first house he built, and also the house \n",

      "Rietveld first met the person who commissioned the house, \n",
      "Truus Schröder-Schräder (1889 - 1985). It was a special \n",

      "The management plan can be divided into three sub-categories:\n",
      "•\t The first chapters provide a description of the actual situation: \n",
      "the site, authorities involved and restrictions.\n",
      "•\t Chapter 5 and 6 represent the core of the plan. Chapter 5 \n",

      "communication, sustainability and finance.\n",
      "The management plan always has large time horizon. The \n",
      "current plan should not be perceived as a static plan. It will be \n",
      "reviewed and updated periodically. This ensures that action \n",
      "points are constantly implemented and new ones are initiated. It \n",
      "is a supporting instrument for the management of the site.\n",
      "APPROACH\n",
      "In 2012, the first management plan of the Rietveld Schröder House \n",
      "was developed in collaboration with the following partners: the \n",
      "Municipality of Utrecht, Centraal Museum, the Stichting Rietveld \n",
      "Schröderhuis (Rietveld Schröder House Foundation), the Cultural \n",

      "consultation with the respective Boards of our partners, ensuring \n",
      "their smooth adoption. The involvement of our partners further \n",
      "ensures a continuous commitment to sharing knowledge and \n",

      "Utrecht. With this management plan, both parties confirm their \n",

      "Schröderhuis, the Municipality of Utrecht, and Stichting Centraal \n",
      "Museum. Agreements between the latter two parties have been \n",

      "of the number of visitors, it was decided in 2019 to have the \n",
      "matter researched extensively, in collaboration with Centraal \n",
      "Museum, TU Delft, SRAL and TNO, and with the support of the \n",
      "Getty Foundation (as part of the Keeping It Modern initiative). \n",
      "The research eventually resulted in a research report and \n",
      "publications with conclusions and recommendations.\n",
      "Conclusions and recommendations\n",
      "Based on the results of climate monitoring, it can be concluded \n",
      "that the current interior climate is mainly influenced by variations \n",
      "in the outdoor climate. This can be noticed most clearly on the \n",
      "first floor. The effect that visitors have on the interior climate is \n",
      "negligible. This is probably due to the small number of visitors \n",
      "(approximately 12 visitors per floor per visit ) and the strong \n",
      "ventilation thanks to the fairly open building structure. In the \n",
      "heating season, periods with higher-than-desired temperatures \n",
      "and with lower-than-desired relative humidity values were \n",
      "registered, mainly as the result of a malfunction in the heating \n",
      "system. Very high humidity values were measured during the \n",
      "summer season. The building’s interior climate largely falls \n",
      "within the ASHRAE control class C, which can be considered to \n",
      "be the climate control class that is possible for this building \n",
      "(non-insulated brickwork, single glass panes, heating without \n",
      "humidity control). The risk of mechanical damage to the furniture \n",
      "is low. Based on the results of the monitoring, the proposal is to \n",
      "monitor the interior temperature and humidity level, and to \n",
      "implement an alarm system to enable quick intervention in case \n",
      "of a malfunctioning heating system.\n",
      "To lower the relative humidity in the summer season, \n",
      "dehumidifying the air can be considered as an option. \n",
      "Ventilation alone will not be sufficient, as the absolute humidity \n",
      "outside is high in summer.\n",
      "There is no reason to reduce the number of visitors. No \n",
      "immediate climatological risks were found. The option to replace \n",
      "the original furniture pieces with copies can still be considered \n",
      "to maximise their lifetime, or if other risks (such as mechanical \n",
      "damage caused by visitors) need to be avoided. However, no \n",
      "immediate risk of biological growth or surface condensation \n",
      "were found in the current situation. Still, given several significant \n",
